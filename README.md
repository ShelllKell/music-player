The goal of this exercise is to introduce you to the red-green-refactor cycle of
writing code:

- Red: You have a failing test
- Green: Your tests are passing
- Refactor: Rewrite code you don't like without changing its behavior.

So far, we have only seen the red and green parts of this cycle. Refactoring
is a important skill to become familiar with because it helps us maintain the
quality of our software. You can use this technique on every project you work on,
during class and after.

As you are going through the exercise, try to read each stack trace to understand
why each line is failing and where you need to go to fix it.
